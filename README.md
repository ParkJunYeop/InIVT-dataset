This repository provides you with a sample InIVT dataset.
This dataset is tailored for the research of autonomous driving and developing vehicle models in scenarios which are focused on unexpected traffic incident situations around intersection areas on urban roads.

The dataset is composed of four main scenarios. 
The scenarios encompass incidents around intersection areas with various forms and positions of the geofence.

1.Straight path scenario
